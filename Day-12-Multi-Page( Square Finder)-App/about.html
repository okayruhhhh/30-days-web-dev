<h1>About This Project</h1>

<h2>
  This Square Finder App is a simple multi-page JavaScript application built as part of my learning journey.
  <br/><br/>
  The main goal of this project was to practice:
  <br/>
  • Creating multi-page websites  
  <br/>
  • Separating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  
  <br/>
  • Using JavaScript for calculations and validations  
  <br/>
  • Passing data between pages using localStorage  
  <br/><br/>
  This project helped me understand how JavaScript logic can work across multiple pages while keeping the code organized and readable.
