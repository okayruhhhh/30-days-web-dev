# 30 Days 30 Projects🌱

This repository documents my *30-day web development learning journey*, where I build small, focused projects to **revisit and strengthen fundamentals** while progressing from ***JavaScript -> React ->  MERN***.

The goal is simple:  
learn by building, stay consistent, and improve one step at a time.


## ✨ What this repo includes :

~ Daily mini-projects built during my JS–MERN course.
~ Hands-on practice with core web development concepts.  
~ Gradual transition from basics to more structured applications.

=>Each project reflects what I practiced and learned on that day.
